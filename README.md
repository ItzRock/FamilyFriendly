# Family Friendly
![Logo](https://github.com/ItzRock/FamilyFriendly/blob/main/icon.png)

An adjustable non serious mod that kills you if you swear.

[GitHub](https://github.com/ItzRock/FamilyFriendly), [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/AnthonyStai/FamilyFriendly/)

## How to use
Modify the included "naughtywords.txt" file in the plugin's directory to any words you'd like seperated by a new line. This mod intentionally doesn't include many swear words as the mod REALLY likes to false positive. I recommend using [NVIDIA Broadcast](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/) to prevent background false positives, I've had my chair say "shit" apparently.
